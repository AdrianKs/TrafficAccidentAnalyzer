# TrafficAccidentAnalyzer
## Overview
This Java application enables a detailed analysis of traffic accidents occuring in certain time frames. The application has been developed and tested with sample data of accidents in Toronto, but can easily be expanded to any given city. An interactive heatmap provides a detailed overview of the occuring accidents and hotspots within the city. 
The sources for collecting the accident data are the vehicles themselves. The application analyses sensor data which is transferred from the vehicles to the application. The data is then streamed in specified time frames to update the heatmap.

## General information
- Import the project as "Existing Maven Project"
- Run "App.java" to start the data transfering services and the webserver
